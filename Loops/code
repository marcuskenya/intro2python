1. Using a for loop print values for the dictionary below:

 

my_dict = {
    "apple": 2.99,
    "banana": 1.50,
    "orange": 0.99,
    "grape": 3.50,
    "watermelon": 5.99,
    "pineapple": 4.99
}

2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
 But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number,
  and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
 For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
